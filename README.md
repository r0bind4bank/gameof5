# gameof5
python project

By design, the game asks for the size of the array before it starts (possible values ​​are from 5 to 20).

Then a game is performed in which the players alternately insert tic-tac-toe (given the row and column of the field).

The game should help users by displaying the current situation in the game in the form of a table:

The game ends when one of the players has 5 pieces next to each other vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
